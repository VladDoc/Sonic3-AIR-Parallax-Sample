# Sonic3-AIR-Parallax-Sample
Custom parallax backgrounds mod sample for Sonic 3 AIR

Use in your own published mods at your own discretion

# Limitations so far
- No vertical scrolling yet(and I do not mean vertical parallax like in Ice Cap act 1), just offseting layers vertically
- Angel Island Act 1 mid level miniboss cutscene has background done as foreground element so it overlays your custom bg there
- Angel Island Act 2 bomber scene blatantly loops camera.x position and makes scrolling jarring
- Same for Mushroom Hill act 2 boss sequence
- There are no 'graceful' background scroll offset transition between acts
- No indoor/outdoor background transitions for Ice Cap zone and Flying Battery zone
- Marble Garden Act 2 earthquake sequence has level foreground tiles with hardcoded green color(in vanilla too)
- Marble Garden Act 2 boss fight has zero scrolling due to camera.x position being still
- Flying Battery Act 2 after lazer boss sequence has vanilla bg overriding the custom one
- No BG animations
- No color transitions
- No layers that move based on time

# Current Parallax bg list:
- Marble Garden Zone
- Carnival Night Zone
- Mushroom Hill Zone
